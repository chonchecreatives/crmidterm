      <h2>Art(Acrylic/Drawing/Design)</h2>
      <h5>Desire</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="../GRC-275b-Midterm-CarlosR/IMG_6029.jpg" width=300 height=300> <img src="../GRC-275b-Midterm-CarlosR/clown%20girl.png" width=250 height=300></div>
      <p>Titled "jesus are u listening"</p>
      <p>Ever since I could hold a pencil I was always interested in art. My very first vivid memory was me winning a clown drawing contest in 2nd grade, only using 3 colors and got it hung up in the main library here in Las Vegas. My main area of "expertise" would be acrylic, as I find it way easier then oil paint and a bit cheaper lol. Most of my art stems from my trauma growing up in a religious household. If im not painting I also love drawing. Its where i get to express myself more frely as I can easily make mistakes without have to worry about colors mmxing etc. From painting and drawing is where I found interest in design as it allowed be to be more professinal while still doing art. </p>
      <h2>Makeup</h2>
      <h5>Expression</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"> <img src="../GRC-275b-Midterm-CarlosR/MC_HF.jpg" width=300 height=300> <img src="../GRC-275b-Midterm-CarlosR/IMG_6031.jpg" width=300 height=300></div>
      <p> Image for my photoshop class</p>
      <p> I have always loved the concept of makeup. being able to add a few shadows or colors to your face and look different blows my mind. I started playling around with makeup around summer 2020 as thats when I finally came out and let all my bottled up emotionas come out through art. I like to play around with blood as I find its a cool concept and its a stereotype that queer people love them some horror hahaha. Makeup also me to express my emotions that I couldnt as a child and lets me create a persona online that represents what I feel inside.</p>
      <h2>Music</h2>
      <h5> Daydream</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"> <img src="../GRC-275b-Midterm-CarlosR/sky.webp" width=200 height=200> <img src="../GRC-275b-Midterm-CarlosR/arca.jpeg" width=200 height=200> <img src="../GRC-275b-Midterm-CarlosR/machine.jpeg" width=200 height=200></div>  
      <p> Fav Albums </p>
      <p> Music for me has always been an escape from reality. Just syncing in with the music and enjoy all the sounds and beats. I enjoy most experimental music as all the beats and sounds all at once just do it for me. Im also a big fan of indie music as it lets me think im apeart of the song and story lol. Some of my favorite artists are Sky Ferreria, Arca, MachineGirl, Lana Del Rey and much more. Music just lets me relax and underdtands me whem im in pain or any mood. </p>
